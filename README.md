## About
The Active Galactic Nuclei Interactive Tool for Exploration, or AGNITE, is a visualization tool for 
the [Unified Model of AGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus?oldformat=true#Unification_of_AGN_species). 
AGNITE operates as a cloud-hosted web app allowing a user to explore how the optical spectrum and SED of AGN changes as the viewing angle changes.
