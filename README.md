# AGNITE

## About
The Active Galactic Nuclei Interactive Tool for Exploration, or AGNITE, is a visualization tool for 
the [Unified Model of AGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus?oldformat=true#Unification_of_AGN_species). 
AGNITE operates as a cloud-hosted web app allowing a user to explore how the optical spectrum and SED of AGN changes as the viewing angle changes.

This project is fully web-accessible but 
can be installed locally as well through the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eagiman/agnite.git
cd agnite
```

Once ensuring `streamlit` and all packages in requirements.txt are installed, the app
can be run locally through

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
